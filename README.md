# LensX - Capture the essence
LensX is a camera with no lens. Instead, it uses AI to generate a "photo" of a specific place and moment using the phone's current location, time, weather, and surrounding environment.

## How it works
LensX uses OpenAI's DALL.E 3 to generate an image via a text prompt. 
<br>
<br>
This text prompt is generated automatically by reverse geocaching your current location to identify your surroundings, and also incorporates the current time, date, weather, season, and lighting conditions (golden hour, overcast, etc). Additionally, LensX allows users to specify whether they are indoors or outdoors, and has a selection of filters that completely transforms the generated photo.

## Choosing a location
LensX takes the user's live location data to search for surrounding landmarks. Users are able to pinpoint and select their exact location to generate a photo that best captures the essence of a specific place and moment.

## Reimagined worlds
LensX has a selection of advanced filters, allowing users to reimagine their whole photo, such as into a world crafted by yarn and wool, or as a little buildings and figurines in a diorama.
